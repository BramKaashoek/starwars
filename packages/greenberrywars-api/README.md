## Why Typescript?

Fail early, Fail often. I prefer to have problems in dev over problems in prod.

## Why koa?

Koa is very similar to express, slightly smaller and more modular. I like the ctx, I like the error management.

## Why Apollo?

Because I Love Apollo. Nothing comes close in functionality and use experience.
